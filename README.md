# evolve

This repository is made by small self contained files, which are miniprograms in python that I have created for hobby.

They simulate small steps for a bigger program that might exist someday in the future, but I change my mind quite often and the idea becomes diffuse. For using them, you will need python 3, pyqtgraph, pyopengl and numpy.
